# About me
Hi, I'm Malte, 33 years old, from Munich. Currently, i'm pursuiing a PhD in Statistics at the LMU Munich. 

My main research interests are:  
- Tree Ensemble Methods
- Decision Rules Ensembles
- Interpretable Machine Learning
- General Ensemble Learning
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Regularization

At the same time im working as a Data Science freelancer.
